"Dear Director,\n"

"This message comes from the Department of Defense at the Terran Sovereign "
"Consortium with an urgent and significant update.\n"
"\n"
"The Planetary Orbital Defense Network (PODN) has been unable to effectively "
"counter the recent extraterrestrial threat. Given these circumstances, the "
"TSC has decided to transfer the responsibility of planetary defense to the "
"Earth Vanguard Alliance (EVA), effective immediately.\n"
"\n"
"We believe in EVA's superior capabilities to handle this critical situation. "
"In support of your efforts, the TSC has also approved an additional budget "
"to aid in your defense operations against the alien forces.\n"
"\n"
"We trust that EVA will utilize these resources strategically and keep us "
"informed of your progress. Your swift action in this matter is imperative "
"for our planet's security.\n"
